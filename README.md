* **Vector:** Data is rendered on device using OpenGL ES 2.0, with style applied on the fly. It's easy to load your own data layers from *GeoJSON* files and integrate layers to the map.
* **Fast:** GLMap uses all CPU cores along with GPU to render map really fast.
* **Customizable:**  Everything on map could be customized very fast. *MapCSS* is used to describe map style.
